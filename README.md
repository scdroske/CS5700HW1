# README #

This repository contains variations of an example "shapes" library.  The shapes library is intended to provide some simple abstractions for creating, using, and manipulating 2D objects, including points, lines, circles, etc.  The different variations illustrate alternative designs which follow principles of abstraction, modularization, or encapsulation to varying degrees.

* basic/
  * good design/
    * Reasonably good abstraction, modularization, and encapsulation
    * Unit test cases
  * poor abstraction/
    * Some poor identifiers that are either not meaningful or not context aware
    * Incomplete abstraction for circle (missing a move operation)
    * No consist abstraction for point (redundant public move operations)
  * poor modularization/
  * poor encapsulation/
  * strong encapsulation/
